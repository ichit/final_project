### Summary: 
#### Climate change, which is related to the CO2 concentration, is threatening the earth. This research aims to analyze the trend of increasing CO2 and the variation of temperature in North America on the time scale, as well as investigate the distribution of CO2 and temperature on the spatial scale. The results will support the studies of global warming and reveal the importance of controlling the carbon cycle.
